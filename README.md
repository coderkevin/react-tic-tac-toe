# Tic-Tac-Toe in React

This is an example project of a simple Tic-Tac-Toe Game with some real-world application features.

## Features

- Based on Create React App with Typescript
- Uses emotion for css-in-js styling
- Uses custom created X and O svgs
- Uses eslint and prettier for formatting
- Adds storybook for easy component development

## Future Feature Ideas

These are the parts I'm thinking about adding later

- Unit testing (especially for game business logic)
- Add option to select larger grid (the code already supports it)
- Add option to select player count (the code already should support it, would need more symbols)
- Add option for how long of a line wins the game (e.g. on a 5x5 board, a line of 4 wins)
- Add game selection box for the above options
- AI Player(s)?
- Websocket implementation so you can play with a friend online
